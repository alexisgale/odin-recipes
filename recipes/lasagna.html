      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>24 oz marinara sauce</li>

      <li>Fresh basil for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned.
        Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the marinara sauce, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
        Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and a pinch of salt.
        Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the
        bottom. Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a
        layer of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan. Repeat the layers
        until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of mozzarella and
        Parmesan on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then remove
        the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is
        bubbly and golden.
      </li>

        Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh
        basil if desired.
