    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy and has become a global
      favorite. It's made with a yeasted flatbread base, topped with tomato
      sauce, cheese, and various toppings. Whether you prefer classic Margherita
      or loaded with toppings, pizza is always a crowd-pleaser.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sliced bell peppers (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sliced black olives (optional)</li>
      <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
      <li>Olive oil for brushing</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it
        in the oven to heat up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with
        parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border
        around the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, bell peppers, and black
        olives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and pepper to taste. Brush the edges of the dough with
        olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza to the stone. If
        not, place the baking sheet with the pizza in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is
        bubbly and slightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh
        basil leaves if desired. Slice and serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
